Status: Hacking towards something

Build status: Ha, ha. No. It won't do anything, right now.

Summary : Adds the ability for instructors to create assignments, which their students can complete by specifying an MDID Presentation for submission. 

Basically at the brainstrom phase. Feedback welcome.
